<!-- Create a program that should decode a numeric password of four digits between 0 and 9(include) and inform the sum of number of failed attempts of each index of the password. 
 So, there are 4 digits. The first digit might be 0 or 1 or 2... or 9. Let's say the first number is 3. The loop will probably starts from 0, that until it reach 3 that is iquals 3, it had 3 failed attempts made.
 The function will go to the second the number of the password, will do the same as it did with the first numbers. When it reachs the four number of the password, it has to show the total quantity of failed attempts.-->
